# Named-Entity-Recognition-on-Military-News
Named Entity Recognition on Military News using BERT tokenizer and BERT classifier

* Used an annotated corpus about military news
* Used attention/padding masks to increase model performance against short sentences
* Used *PyTorch* and *BERT* for classification, tokenizing, setting attention masks and tuning.
* Due to the fact that the hardware is not robust enough, only trained for just 3 epochs and reached %79 accuracy with a metric of classifying per word.
